Algorithm: Email Data Cleaning and Feature Extraction

Input: A CSV file containing email data
Output: A CSV file with extracted and processed email features

Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries
    - Import pandas as pd
    - Import numpy as np
    - Import regular expression module as re
    - Import urlparse and parse_qs from urllib.parse
    - Import datetime from datetime module

Step 2: Define Helper Functions
    Function: count_occurrences(char, text)
        - Return the count of char in text
    
    Function: extract_domain_features(url)
        - Parse url to get hostname, path, and query
        - Split hostname to get subdomains
        - Define and return a dictionary with features like:
            Number of dots, subdomain level, path level, URL length, and other relevant URL features

    Function: parse_email_date(date_str)
        - Return datetime object parsed from date_str in a specific format

Step 3: Feature Extraction for Each Email
    Function: process_email(row)
        - Extract URL features using extract_domain_features for 'url' in row
        - Parse email date using parse_email_date for 'received_date' in row
        - Return a dictionary merging URL features and email date

Step 4: Load and Process Data
    - Load email data from 'path_to_emails.csv' using pandas
    - Apply process_email function to each row in the dataset
    - Expand the result to fit dataframe structure

Step 5: Finalize Dataset
    - Concatenate original emails dataframe with processed_emails dataframe
    - Save the combined dataframe to 'processed_email_dataset.csv'

End Algorithm
